I currently help gaming and mobile customers, both internal and external, build Highly Available, Scalable and Reliable platforms and services on Amazon Web Services. I have been a user of AWS for the past 8 years and use my knowledge from my previous development and technical leadership roles to help customers understand, navigate and extract the full benefit of migrating their services to the cloud.

##### **Technical Director**                                2012-2014

At GlobalWide Media I reported to the COO and was responsible for managing the entire technology organization. I managed over 30 people across 3 offices and was heavily involved in the acquisition of Neverblue, starting from pre-purchase technology due diligence to post-acquisition technology integration. My teams supported a variety of digital advertising products built on both AWS and On-Premise infrastructure, and these products drove 9 figures worth of revenue.

### AdColony Inc. ![AdColony Logo](../img/adcolony-logo.png)
##### **Vice President of Technology**                      2011-2012

At AdColony, I reported directly to the CEO and was responsible for managing the entire technology organization. I sucessfully managed the technological and organizational pivot that saw AdColony turn from a hybrid mobile game company/video ad network to a fully dedicated video ad network. This pivot involved the full re-write of the company's video ad platform that I architected and helped build entirely on AWS. Additonally I managed the technology budget, off-shore development and various contracts during my role.

##### **Lead Engineer**                                     2008-2011

At Electronic Arts, I was the Lead Server Engineer for the company's Origin platform. The subset of Origin I was focussed on, powered all of EA's mobile and social gaming portfolio that was played by millions of unique users. The usage numbers of the platform exposed me firsthand to the challenges of scaling backend services, and the importance of Service Oriented Architecture. We used our experience in creating a hybrid cloud and on-premise based services platform that is being still used 5 years after it was first built (an eternity in technology)

### **EDUCATION**
### University of Southern California ![USC Logo](../img/usc.jpg)
##### **PhD in Computer Science**                  2006-Present

I am currently enrolled in the PhD program at USC. While it is on hold since I decided to move on to the industry, I was actively working on my thesis during the years while I was enrolled. My thesis involved the usage of wearable sensors and gaming to promote health in young adults. The purpose was to create fun and challenging gaming prototypes that encouraged physical activities among the youth, using inconspicuous wearable sensor technology to measure and report back such activity. This was way before wearables and IoT became cool.

##### **Masters in Computer Science**                  2004-2006

While pursuing my Masters degree at USC, I worked with [Prof. Mike Zyda](http://gamepipe.usc.edu/~zyda/) to build the USC Gaming Program. I was the first student of the program and worked with the CS Department and various faculty to helped build out course curriculum and determine Research and Development tracks. Today, the [USC Games](http://games.usc.edu/) program is recognized as the best gaming program in the country by the Princeton Review (and many others)
