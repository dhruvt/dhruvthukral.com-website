##### **US 7980997 B2**                  2011

A system for encouraging a user to perform substantial physical activity. The system may include sensors that may be worn by the user while the user is performing a substantial physical activity, such as running or playing basketball. The sensors may detect the magnitude of the physical activity and may transmit data regarding the physical activity to a processing system. The processing system may display a reward to encourage the user for participating in physical activity and the reward provided may be based on the physical activity of the user.

### [Electronically Augmented Smart Lock for Trash Containers](http://www.google.com/patents/US20130087562)
##### **US 20130087562 A1**                                2014

A smart lock that can be built into or mounted onto a trash container with a lid and a can consists of two interlocking parts. The smart lock contains a primary lock operably connected to a secondary lock. The primary lock can be opened in presence of the trash collection vehicle or by a command from the owner. The secondary lock can be opened by the same conditions or when it senses mechanical and gravitational movement characteristics of the collection process, only when the first lock is open. Each lock comprises a timer and electronic circuitry that detects authorized commands and opens the lock.
