# Dhruv Thukral 
### Technologist

I am currently working as an Architect at Amazon Web Services. My focus is on Gaming, Mobile and IoT and my current role allows me to focus on the things that I am most passionate about. 

I work with a variety of large, medium and small companies helping them launch games and platforms on AWS that scale across millions of users. I have worked on the architecture, design, implementation and operations of some of the largest and most popular Console, Mobile & PC Games in the world.  

I have also given multiple talks on multiplayer online games at GDC, Casual Connect Singapore, re:Invent, PAX-Dev, and many others. If you're using AWS for gaming, there's a good chance our paths have crossed.
