### Technologist

I am currently an Engineering Manager at Hulu and my focus is on creating the best uninterrupted experiences for our customers. 

Prior to Hulu, I was a Principal Architect at Amazon where I worked with a variety of internal and external stakeholders helping them launch games and digital service platforms on AWS that scale across millions of users. I have worked on the architecture, design, implementation and operations of some of the largest and most popular Console, Mobile & PC Games in the world.  

I have also given multiple talks on scalable and highly available architectures and systems at large conferences like GDC, Casual Connect, re:Invent, PAX-Dev, and many others. If you're using AWS as your cloud provider, there's a good chance our paths have crossed.
