##### **Amazon Web Services**                  2016

This whitepaper discusses the exciting usecase of running multiplayer game servers in the AWS Cloud and the optimizations that you can make to achieve the highest level of performance. In this whitepaper, we provide you the information you need to take advantage of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) family of instances to get the peak performance required to successfully  run a multiplayer game server on Linux in AWS.

Most of us are aware of the support for a developer authentication backend in Amazon Cognito and how one can use a custom backend service to authenticate and authorize users to access AWS resources using temporary credentials. In this blog, we will create a quick serverless backend authentication API written in Java and deployed on Lambda.

### [Enabling a voice modality in mobile games through VoiceXML](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401870)
##### **ACM Siggraph**                                2008

The use of speech recognition in gaming applications is not entirely new. The growth of voice as a part of gaming has exploded largely due to the popularity of online player matchmaking services such as Xbox Live. Yet, the majority of its use is only limited to communications between players to coordinate game play activities through the use of a headset and a microphone. To further explore the possibilities of using speech recognition to affect game play directly, Motorola has partnered with GamePipe Labs at the University of Southern California. This collaboration aims at leveraging the capabilities of VoiceXML (VXML), and use interactive voice dialogues to directly affect game play on mobile phones. This short paper describes the efforts taken under this initiative, and the results of this collaboration.

### [Educating the Next Generation of Mobile Game Developers](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cg/2007/02/mcg2007020096-abs.html)
##### **IEEE Computer Society**                                2007

Almost every major publisher and developer in the game industry is dedicating a major part of their effort on mobile games. Realizing that there is a huge foreseeable demand for mobile game developers, Motorola has formed a partnership with GamePipe Labs at the University of Southern California. The purpose of this partnership is to provide a platform to train the next generation of mobile game developers using design principles unique to mobile games. The authors describe the process, challenges, and results of this effort from both the technical and design aspects.
